STDM Lab nr.1 "Creational Design Patterns" Rusu Dacian

Task:

Choose an OO programming language and a suitable IDE or Editor (No frameworks/libs/engines allowed);

Select a domain area for the sample project;

Define the main involved classes and think about what instantiation mechanisms are needed;

Based on the previous point, implement atleast 3 creational design patterns in your project;

Theory:

In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation. Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system use. Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

We have the following examples of Creational Design Patterns:

1)Abstract Factory -Creates an instance of several families of classes

2)Builder -Separates object construction from its representation

3)Factory Method -Creates an instance of several derived classes

4)Object Pool - Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use

5)Prototype- A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned

6)Singleton-A class of which only a single instance can exist

Explanation:

In my project I have implemented the following design patterns: Factory, AbstractFactory, Builder and Singleton. As a blueprint I have used the Animal hierarchy. I have gone further to get to the needed level of abstraction. Abstract Factory is implemented with Factory method so using these DP we obtained 2 levels of abstraction.
